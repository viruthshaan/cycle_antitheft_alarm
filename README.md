# Cycle Anti-Theft Alarm System

## Introduction
I had the opportunity to work on an independent design project during my fourth semester, aiming to enhance my hands-on experience in product design. This led to the development of a Cycle Anti-Theft Alarm System.

## Project Goal
The main objective of this project was to create a solution that allows cycle users to securely leave their cycles in parking areas without fear of theft.

## Project Description
I started with the conceptual design phase, using a point system to select the enclosure and schematic for the product. To reduce costs associated with 3D printing, we opted for a prebuilt enclosure. This required the creation of a custom circuit board and internal enclosure parts to fit seamlessly.

Solidworks was employed for designing the internal enclosure, while Altium was used for the schematic and PCB.

## Key Features
- A loud alarm system is integrated.
- The device is powered by a 3s Li-Ion battery.
- An LED indicator displays the working mode of the device.
